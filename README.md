# Brawl Engine

Brawl Engine is a hobby project that aims to create an easy-to-use yet quite powerful game engine
for games. It is written in C++ but it is designed to allow the user to use Lua
for scripting and defining game logic. The engine is designed to be used for fighting games (hence the name) but it
should be flexible enough to be used for other types of games as well.
